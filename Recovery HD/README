To use this Makefile, you need to:

1.  Grab dmtest from Lion Recovery Update v1.0 http://support.apple.com/kb/DL1464 and copy it to the same directory as the Makefile.  pkgutil --expand RecoveryHDUpdate.pkg RecoveryUpdate.  Path to dmtest will be /RecoveryUpdate/RecoveryHDUpdate.pkg/Scripts/Tools
2.  Copy BaseSystem.chunklist and BaseSystem.dmg from the InstallESD.dmg to the same directory as the Makefile.  These are hidden so you will need to chflags nohidden the files after copying them locally.
3.  Customize the Reverse domain for you company
4.  Set Package_Version with the appropriate build number
